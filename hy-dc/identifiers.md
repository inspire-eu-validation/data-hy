# Identifiers

**Version**: 1

**Purpose**: Verify that identifiers are managed properly.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

* Verify that identifiers are reusing authoritative, pan-European sources, i.e. review for each feature that, if a geographical name is used as a unique hydrologic ID for an object in this specification that it is derived, where possible, from a pan-European Gazetteer or another authoritative, pan-European source.
* Verify that identifiers are consistent with the reporting under the Water Framework Directive, i.e. review for each feature that the localId attribute of the external object identifier is the same as the ID used for reporting obligations under Directive 2000/60/EC.
